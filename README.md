[CSS Global Order](http://tanalin.com/en/projects/css-global-order/) is a JavaScript library that implements support for visual reordering of HTML elements with the standard `order` CSS-property without need for turning-on Flexbox mechanism (`display: flex` / `display: inline-flex`) for their parent element.

The library works in all Flexbox-capable browsers (including older browsers that support its draft versions with prefixes) and Internet Explorer 7+.
